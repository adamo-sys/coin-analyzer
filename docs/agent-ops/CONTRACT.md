# Coin Analyzer Agent Operations Contract

## Purpose

This file defines the default operating boundaries for AI agents working
on the Coin Analyzer repository.

These rules apply regardless of model, harness, scheduler, or vendor.

## Core Principles

1. Prefer bounded, reviewable changes over broad rewrites.
2. Preserve Coin Analyzer's local-first architecture.
3. Do not weaken existing safety, privacy, validation, or governance boundaries.
4. Treat repository evidence as authoritative over assumptions.
5. Do not claim work succeeded without evidence.
6. Keep durable project decisions in repository files rather than agent memory.

## Default Authority

Unless a task explicitly grants additional authority, an agent may:

- inspect repository files;
- navigate and analyze code;
- inspect issues and pull requests;
- propose implementation slices;
- edit files on a non-default branch when implementation is requested;
- add or update focused tests;
- run focused validation;
- commit bounded changes;
- prepare a pull request.

An agent must not assume authority to:

- push directly to `main`;
- bypass or weaken required CI;
- disable tests to obtain a passing result;
- publish a release;
- alter secrets or credentials;
- perform destructive repository operations;
- mutate a user's coin collection merely as a side effect of acquisition,
  import, analysis, or discovery;
- introduce cloud or remote dependencies that violate local-first behavior;
- silently expand the requested scope.

## Git Rules

- Work from an up-to-date base.
- Never perform implementation directly on the default branch.
- Use a dedicated branch for each bounded change.
- Keep unrelated changes out of the branch.
- Prefer reviewable commits.
- Preserve git history and repository evidence.
- Do not force-push or rewrite shared history without explicit authorization.

## Validation

Before claiming completion:

1. Run the smallest relevant focused tests.
2. Run additional validation required by the affected boundary.
3. Report exactly what was run.
4. Distinguish passing evidence from tests that were not run.
5. Treat GitHub CI as authoritative for repository merge gates.

A prepared command, prompt, or test plan is not evidence that validation ran.

## Scope Control

Every implementation should have:

- one primary objective;
- explicit invariants;
- clear acceptance criteria;
- focused validation.

If accomplishing the task requires meaningful expansion beyond the declared
scope, stop and surface the expansion rather than silently implementing it.

## Evidence and State

Important agent activity should leave durable evidence where appropriate:

- commits;
- pull requests;
- issue comments;
- test results;
- release notes;
- repository documentation;
- machine-readable run ledgers for scheduled agents.

Do not rely on chat history or model memory as the sole record of an
important project decision.

## Scheduled and Autonomous Agents

Scheduled agents must:

- use explicit written instructions;
- maintain durable state between isolated runs when state is required;
- record whether each run completed, skipped, or failed;
- stop safely when assumptions, authentication, permissions, or environment
  conditions differ materially from expectations.

Autonomy should be granted incrementally:

read → analyze → propose → implement → validate → PR → merge → release

A capability being technically possible does not mean it is authorized.

## Conflict Rule

If an agent instruction conflicts with this contract, repository governance,
or a more specific project safety rule, follow the stricter boundary and
surface the conflict.

## Updating This Contract

Change this contract through normal repository review.

Agent behavior should adapt to this file; this file should not be silently
rewritten to accommodate agent behavior.
