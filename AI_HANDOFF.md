## Snapshot

- Date: 2026-06-16
- Branch: `main`
- Current project state file reports release version: `v1.1-dev`
- Current active task completed: v1.1 Shared Session Context

## What Changed

- Added `focused_collection_intelligence.py` with reusable deterministic candidate classification.
- Added Tools -> Do I Own This in `coin_collection_gui.py`.
- Added `test_focused_collection_intelligence.py` with focused unit coverage.
- Refactored `buy_advisor.py` duplicate/upgrade flags to use `FocusedCollectionIntelligenceEngine`.
- Refactored `upgrade_advisor.py` match/upgrade decisions to use `FocusedCollectionIntelligenceEngine`.
- Added regression tests proving both advisors route through the focused engine while preserving existing verdict behavior.
- Added WANT_LIST context status to focused candidate analysis: `ON_WANT_LIST`, `NOT_ON_WANT_LIST`, `GAP_NOT_EXPLICITLY_TARGETED`, and `WANT_LIST_UNAVAILABLE`.
- Added a lightweight Load WANT_LIST Context button to Tools -> Do I Own This.
- Added `acquisition_workflow.py`, a deterministic purchase-guidance service using the focused Collection Intelligence Engine as its decision source.
- Buy Advisor now stores the acquisition workflow result as supporting structured context while preserving existing user-visible behavior.
- Do I Own This shows acquisition guidance when asking price is provided.
- Completed v1.0 release-readiness audit with app/tool smoke checks, export smoke checks, tag metadata verification, and full regression suite.
- Tagged v1.0 at `2c3d68bc65fcb2f3787f9a3d7624bd49675684c7`.
- Added post-v1.0 packaging docs: README refresh, release notes, release history, screenshot guide, and backup guide.
- Added `session_context.py` with shared per-session workbook and WANT_LIST context models.
- Added Tools -> Load Collection Context and Tools -> Clear Session Context, plus a lightweight session status line in `coin_collection_gui.py`.
- Do I Own This, Acquisition Workflow guidance, Buy Advisor, Want List Generator, Portfolio Import Preview, and Want List Preview can now reuse loaded shared WANT_LIST/workbook context while preserving manual load fallbacks.
- Added `test_session_context.py` for empty context, successful loads, missing/invalid workbook handling, shared consumer behavior, clearing state, and manual workflow preservation.
- Updated `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `TASK_QUEUE.md` as source-of-truth files.

## Engine Scope

The focused engine accepts manual candidate input and returns structured output:

- Match status
- Best existing match
- Grade comparison
- Collection impact
- Recommendation
- Confidence score
- Priority reasons
- Warning flags
- WANT_LIST status
- Shared session context status

The acquisition workflow adds:

- Asking price
- Max rational price
- BUY/PASS/WATCH/NEGOTIATE/REVIEW recommendation
- Owned/current match summary
- Upgrade status

Supported statuses:

- `ALREADY_OWNED`
- `BETTER_GRADE_UPGRADE`
- `SAME_GRADE_DUPLICATE`
- `LOWER_GRADE_DUPLICATE`
- `WANT_LIST_MATCH`
- `COLLECTION_GAP`
- `NOT_RELEVANT`
- `NEEDS_REVIEW`

## Guardrails

- Do not add OCR, image recognition, scraping, or market-price automation as part of this engine.
- Keep this engine deterministic and testable.
- Do not modify `data/collection.json` from analysis workflows.
- Keep Buy Advisor, Upgrade Advisor, Want List Generator, Collection Gap Report, and import previews stable unless the active task explicitly targets them.

## Test Status

- `.\run_tests.bat`: 213 tests OK.
- GUI smoke for Do I Own This, Buy Advisor, Upgrade Advisor, Want List Generator, Collection Gap Report, and Portfolio Import Preview passed.
- Export smoke for collection CSV, gap CSV, want-list CSV/Markdown, portfolio preview CSV, and WANT_LIST preview CSV passed.
- Tag metadata verified for `v0.5` through `v1.0`; `v1.0` points to `2c3d68bc65fcb2f3787f9a3d7624bd49675684c7`.
- Local GUI smoke for v1.1 could not run because this Python/Tcl install cannot find `init.tcl`.
- Direct multi-module `py -m unittest ...` commands may still hit the intermittent Windows launcher issue; use `run_tests.bat` as the project runner.

## Known Limitations

- Fuzzy matching is deterministic and intentionally basic.
- Variety matching depends on existing text fields such as reference, title, notes, and comments.
- Shared Session Context is per app session only; it does not persist loaded workbook or WANT_LIST state after closing the app.
- Buy Advisor still keeps its legacy collection-intelligence boost scoring separate from duplicate/upgrade classification to preserve current user-visible behavior.
- Acquisition workflow max rational price is rule-based internal guidance only; it is not market pricing.
- GUI workflows still have limited automated coverage.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Perform a focused v1.1 acceptance audit for Shared Session Context.
2. Improve Buy Advisor validation messages.
3. Add GUI autocomplete for country and denomination.
4. Decide whether acquisition workflow guidance should become visible in Buy Advisor reports.
5. Expand normalization fixtures for country, denomination, and variety edge cases.
